## This is our little clone of Terraria
We tried to recreate an 2-D sideview platformer using only SDL.
In this project, we wanted to do most of the things ourselves, such as rendering blocks, calculating physics, calculating the area of water (well, it's 2D after all), and calculating shadows and lightning.
## Functions
 - Movement by A, D, and spacebar keys
 - Switch game modes (F1 - survival; F2 - spectator)
 - Drain large pools of water; it's very satisfying
 - Left mouse button (LMB) - place blocks, right mouse button (RMB) - break blocks via smart cursor
 - Mouse wheel to change inventory slots
 - You have 100 torches; place them carefully

## Installation
 - Just run
      ```Release\TerrariaClone.exe```
